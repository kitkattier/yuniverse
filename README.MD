# welcome to the **yuniverse**

this app provides many features mainly revolving around creation of clubs and events.

## some IMPORTANT notes to the person testing this website

- PLEASE try to use **firefox** while testing this website. I did not have enough time to test it out on all browsers, so in theory it should definitely work on every browser, it has only been tested for firefox.
- the main search bar on the navbar **DOES NOT** work. HOWEVER, the search bars on the /clubs and /events pages do work. For marking purposes, it would be awesome if I could be marked on just those.
- on the events page, when you click on the icons on the map, ON THE FIRST CLICK it zooms in and on the SECOND click it displays information about the event.

## other IMPORTANT Notes

- **PLEASE** do not reload the website, especially the map exccesively. Use it as much as you'd like, but if you say _spam_ reload it that would not be good
- (this is because i am using the mapbox api and if i use too many requests it is going to charge me money)
- also, please handle the api key with care ^\_^

## Advanced feature

- when making a new event, the pin on the map can be dragged and dropped to select a location. this basically does a reverse search on the coordinates and gets the location name. (reverse geocoding)

## AI Usage

- chat gpt and copilot were used to aid with the created of docstrings.
- copilot autocompletions were used to auto complete some code for faster typing. these were snippets that either \(a\) I had already written similar stuff to and just needed change in variable names eg. clubs vs events \(b\) was really basic stuff like generating component stubs.
